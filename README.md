## Overview

Welcome to SupplySignal, your go-to solution for efficiently monitoring and managing supply chain risks. In today's complex global landscape, disruptions in the supply chain can have far-reaching consequences. SupplySignal is here to keep you one step ahead by automatically fetching and analyzing relevant information from various news feeds and disaster watch sources.

## Problem Statement

In the face of intricate supply chains, a hiccup in the operations of even one supplier can grind a company's production to a halt. Traditional methods of monitoring involve sifting through multiple news feeds, a time-consuming process that often leads to delayed responses. SupplySignal addresses this challenge by automating the data collection, filtering, and analysis process, providing users with timely insights to adjust their sourcing operations effectively.
